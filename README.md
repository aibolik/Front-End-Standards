# Resource Front End Standards

Agency developers should:  
- Move quickly.  
- Collaborate.  
- Be consistent.  
- Write quality code.  

Following a style guide helps fulfill these requirements. When our code is cohesive it is easier to read and navigate; there is less friction in collaboration and innovation can flourish.

The purpose of our style guides is not to strictly enforce one way of writing code, but rather to provide a [mostly agreed-upon](https://github.com/resource/Front-End-Standards/issues?direction=desc&labels=&page=1&sort=updated&state=closed) approach. A project's developer lead or architect has the freedom to deviate from these standards when appropriate.
