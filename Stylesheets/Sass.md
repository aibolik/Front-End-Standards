### <a name='definitions'>Definitions</a>  
Sass is generally awesome and people that use it get free pancakes at IHOP.
There are two styles of syntax: .sass and .scss. The .sass style is a "looser" style that omits brackets {} and semi-colons. This document outlines usage of the .scss style. For more on why .scss is our preferred style check out the following articles - [sass-lang docs](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#syntax) [Sass vs Scss](http://thesassway.com/articles/sass-vs-scss-which-syntax-is-better)

Any reference made to "Sass" moving forward is in respect to the .scss notation. Because saying "Sass" out loud is easier than "Scss", which just sounds like a snake hissing. Just want to make sure we're all on the same page :)

### <a name='formatting'>Formatting</a>
##### Commenting  
- // and /**/

    ```SCSS      
    // I'm a single-line comment that will not be output in the .css file. I am only visible in the .scss file

    /* I'm a multi-line comment native to css that will be present
     * in both the .scss and output .css file
     */
    
    ```
